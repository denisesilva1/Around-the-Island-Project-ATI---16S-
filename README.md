# Around the Island Project-(ATI) - Moorea Island, French Polynesia - 16S rRNA gene project
The Around the Island (ATI) 16S project aims to characterize the diversity and composition of microbial 
communities in coral reef environments. Environmental DNA (eDNA) samples were collected between 2021 and 2023 
from 200 sites around the Moorea island (French Polynesia), spanning five reef habitats: bays, mid-lagoon, fringing reefs,
reef crest, and reef passes.
